# Railgun Discord Bot (Coded W/ C#)
Railgun is a multi-purpose Discord bot who is capable of performing various tasks. She is powered by .NETCore v2.1.0, Discord.Net Library & coded using C#.

## Can I download Railgun's Source Code?
It is best to not download the source code. The reason being is due to Railgun utilizing a library called AudioChord which has been developed by myself & mrspits4ever and requires additional parts such as FFMPEG & MongoDB as this library manages the interaction with the database.

You may review the code and use different pieces, however please do not straight up copy it. For further info, please contact us via [CM1's Bot Development Studio](https://discord.gg/Czw5ffx).
